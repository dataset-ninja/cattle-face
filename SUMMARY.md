**Cattle Face** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 142 images with 142 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *20*, *45*, *54*, and other: *60*, *71*, and *80*.

Each image in the Cattle Face dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (1 images), *valid* (27 images), and *train* (114 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Roboflow community](https://roboflow.com/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
